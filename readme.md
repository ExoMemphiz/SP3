Persistance with JPA

1)

We have handled persistance with the use of mappers to communicate with the database, as this ensures that no calls can be made except the premade to the DB.

2)

Pros:

The code is produced at a much faster rate (Auto generation) and tables in the database can be auto-generated by the Entities, ensuring no need for time for Database design/setup.

Cons:

We don’t have a necessity to learn/know the “low” level of the workings, thus if we never were thought about databases in 2. Semester we would have minimal knowledge about those.

3)

Uses one standard way of creating and doing the mapping to the database, as well as the way the database is used and set up.

4)

The main points are of JPA is to ensure that there is a persistent way to store classes and objects to a database without making extra work for the developer.
